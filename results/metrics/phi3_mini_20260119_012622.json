It was designed by Gustave Eiffel, whose company constructed it between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair held in Paris. Today, with an estimated height of around 324 meters including antennas at its top, when opened for visitors (without elevators), one must climb approximately seven flights of stairs to reach the second level and another seventeen floors or so using a lift from there. The Eiffel Tower is widely recognized as France's most visited monument and an iconic symbol of French culture and ingenuity, attracting millions of visitors annually who come not only to marvel at its architectural grandeur but also because it has become synonymous with the romantic allure of Paris itself.",

To find out what percentage of Earth\u2019s oxygen comes from just the portion in Brazil, we calculate:\n\nBrazil's Amazonian contribution to global O\u2082 production = (5.5 million km\u00b2 * 60%) * 20%\n= (3.3 million km\u00b2) * 20%\n= 660,000 km\u00b2 worth of oxygen-producing forests in Brazil contribute to the Earth's total O\u2082 production. Since these Amazonian rainforests produce a fixed percentage of global oxygen regardless of their size or location within Brazil itself (as long as they are part of the larger Amazon), we can say that:\n\nBrazilian portion contributes 20% * (5.5 million km\u00b2 / total world's area) to Earth\u2019s O\u2082 production, which equals exactly 1%, because the entirety of Brazilian territory would contribute only a fractional percentage due to its small size relative to global coverage by rainforests that produce oxygen.",

Calculate how much of the world\u2019s total area covered by the Amazon rainforest comes from Brazil (60%): Since this value seems to refer only to land coverage and not specifically oxygen production areas within that forest region in Brazil, it's likely an error or miscommunication as forests do not directly contribute their percentage of a country\u2019s total area. Nonetheless, we can proceed with the information provided regarding Amazon rainforest cover (5.5 million km\u00b2).\n\n2. Calculate how much oxygen is produced by Brazilian part: Since it's given that 6% of Earth's oxygen comes from this region and there seems to be no direct correlation between land area covered in the question, we might assume for simplicity purposes here (and without further data on forest distribution) that all or nearly all Amazon rainforest contributes similarly. This means if Brazilian part covers 60% of the total Amazon's oxygen-producing areas:\n   - Oxygen contribution from Brazil = Total oxygen production by Amazon",

Here\u2019s how to calculate it:\n\nIf 20% of Earth's O\u2082 is produced by the Amazon rainforest, then Brazilian part producing around a third should be calculated as follows - We take 6% and divide it into three equal parts since this represents roughly one-third contribution from these forests. So each quarter would account for about 2% (since 6% divided by 3 equals to approximately 2%).\n\nTherefore, the Brazilian part of Amazon rainforest produces around 2% of Earth's oxygen.",

However, since we know that these negotiations led to the Treaty of Versailles and this treaty was signed on June 28, 1919, it's reasonable to infer that discussions commenced shortly after WWI ended on November 11, 1918. Since a six-month period is mentioned as having passed during the negotiations without specifying when within those months they started or concluded, one could assume this took place at some point between early December 1918 and mid May 1919 for these discussions to lead up to June of that same year.",
      "response_b": "The question you've asked relates to a detail within the context provided but has an incorrect reference date for the Treaty of Versailles, which was actually signed in June 1919. Since there is no direct information on when exactly peace negotiations began after WWI until November 11, 1918 (which marks its end), we can infer that discussions started shortly before this date considering the time required for formal diplomatic processes to conclude a treaty of such magnitude typically take some months. However, without specific details in the provided context about the start dates of peace negotiations after November 11, 1918, I am unable to provide an exact answer based on your request alone. Historical records indicate that discussions began almost immediately following the armistice but pinpointing a precise date requires more detailed historical data not present in this context.",

Based on the correct historical timeline, World War I (WWI) ended with the armistice of November 11, 1918. Peace negotiations began shortly after this date but took several months. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919 following these negotiations and not January as stated erroneously twice in your context.\n\nSo the peace negotiations for WWI effectively started on November 11, 1918 (the armistice day), which lasted until May of 1919 when they concluded with a preliminary agreement known as the Armistice Convention or Armistice Agreement. Following this convention and further negotiations, the Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 24, 1919 (not June 28).\n\nIf we correct for these errors in your context:\nThe peace negotiations after World War I began immediately following the armistice agreement on November 11, 1918.

From iPhone 3G to iPhone 4 release, there was a gap from July 2008 to June 2010 = approximately 1 year and 9 months or about 25 months considering partial years as full for this purpose because the time between two consecutive releases is consistent in both cases.\n\nSo on average: (13 + 25) / 2 = 38/2",

In 2021, there was a growth of 50%, meaning that Company X's revenues increased by half of its previous revenue ($100M / 2 = $50M). This gives us a total revenue for 2021 as follows:\n    Revenue in 2021 = Initial revenue + Growth  \n                           = $100 million + $50 million    \n                           = $150 million.\n- In the following year, which is 2022, revenues declined by 20%.

Since they started with $100M in 2020, here is how we can find out their revenues per annum:\n    - In 2021, Company X saw a growth of 50%. To get the revenue for that year, multiply its initial amount by (1 + percentage change): $100M * (1 + 0.5) = $150M.  \n    - Then in 2022, they experienced an increase of only 20%, so apply this rate to the previous year's revenue: $150M * (1 + 0.2) = $180M.\n    \nSo Company X had revenues as follows from 2020-2022 ($ in millions):  \n    - 2020 : $100",
